## MICROBIOLOGY
**Dataset**: mcgc.tsv  
**Link**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/mcgc.tsv

# Tasks:
1. Plot growth curves (OD600 vs Time) for all strains with knock-out (-) and knock-in (+) overlays.
2. Use a logistic growth-like estimation function to determine the time to reach carrying capacity.
3. Generate scatter and box plots for time-to-carrying-capacity comparisons between strains.
4. Check for statistical significance in growth differences.

# BIOCHEMISTRY& ONCOLOGY 
**Datasets**: 
- SIFT: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/main/R/datasets/sift.tsv
- FoldX: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/main/R/datasets/foldX.tsv

### Tasks:
1. Merge datasets using a combined identifier `specific_Protein_aa`.
2. Identify deleterious mutations using SIFT < 0.05 and FoldX > 2 criteria.
3. Generate frequency tables, barplots, and pie charts for amino acid mutations.
4. Report the most frequent amino acids affecting both structure and function.

# PUBLIC HEALTH
**Dataset**: NHANES  
**Link**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/main/R/nhanes.csv

# Tasks:
1. Clean dataset by handling NA values.
2. Visualize BMI, Weight, Pounds, and Age distributions.
3. Compute summary statistics (mean pulse, blood pressure range, income variance).
4. Visualize weight-height relationship.
5. Conduct t-tests between variables (e.g., Age vs Gender, BMI vs Diabetes).
