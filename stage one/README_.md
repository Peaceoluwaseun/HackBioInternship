1. `translate_dna_to_protein(dna_sequence)`: Translates a DNA sequence into a protein string.
2. `simulate_logistic_growth(t_max, K, r, N0)`: Simulates a logistic growth curve with random lag and exponential phases.
3. `generate_growth_curves(n)`: Generates `n` growth curves using the above simulation.
